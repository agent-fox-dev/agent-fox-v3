"""CLI command for the night-shift autonomous maintenance daemon.

Runs continuously, scanning the codebase on a timed schedule using both
static tooling and AI-powered agents to discover maintenance issues.
Each finding is reported as a platform issue. Issues labelled ``af:fix``
are automatically processed through the full archetype pipeline and a
pull request is opened per fix.

Requirements: 61-REQ-1.1, 61-REQ-1.2, 61-REQ-1.3, 61-REQ-1.4

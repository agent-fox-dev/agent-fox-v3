"""Event dataclasses for fix command progress reporting.

FixProgressEvent and CheckEvent are transient in-memory event objects used
to communicate progress from the fix/improve loops to the CLI display layer.
All parameters default to None for full backward compatibility — existing
callers that do not pass callbacks are unaffected.

Requirements: 76-REQ-4.*, 76-REQ-5.*, 76-REQ-6.*

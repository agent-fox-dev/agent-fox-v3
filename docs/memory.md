## Gotchas

- Click 8.3+ removed `CliRunner(mix_stderr=False)` parameter — use `CliRunner()` without arguments. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- Error hierarchy stubs are complete implementations (just class definitions inheriting from AgentFoxError), so tests pass immediately without additional code — this is expected and correct. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- Config property tests in tests/property/core/ fail until task group 3 implements load_config(); this is expected behavior and not a regression. *(source: 01_core_foundation/2)*
- ConfigDict(extra='ignore') must be set on every sub-model in a pydantic model hierarchy; setting it only on the top-level model does not automatically apply to nested models. *(source: 01_core_foundation/3)*
- `from __future__ import annotations` causes ruff I001 import sorting errors in files with no type annotations needing it — omit the import when unnecessary. *(source: 01_core_foundation/4)*
- CliRunner inherits the process CWD at invocation time, so `os.chdir()` in `tmp_git_repo` fixture properly affects the init command; test ordering can matter if CWD-changing tests run before others without proper cleanup. *(source: 01_core_foundation/4)*
- Fast-mode filter must compute ordering on a temporary graph excluding optional nodes to prevent edges referencing skipped nodes from confusing the resolver, though the returned TaskGraph retains skipped nodes with SKIPPED status. *(source: 02_planning_engine/4)*
- Cross-spec dependencies from prd.md must be filtered to only include specs in the discovered set before passing to build_graph(), otherwise --spec filtering causes dangling reference errors. *(source: 02_planning_engine/5)*
- Ruff's import sorter (I001) requires third-party imports (e.g., `claude_code_sdk`) to be in a separate group from local imports (e.g., `agent_fox.*`), with blank lines separating the groups. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- Ruff rule UP041 requires using builtin TimeoutError instead of asyncio.TimeoutError — they are the same class in Python 3.11+ but ruff flags the alias as incorrect. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/3)*
- When rebasing a feature branch that is checked out in a worktree, `git rebase <onto> <branch>` fails with 'already used by worktree' error. Run `git rebase <onto>` without the branch argument from within the worktree directory instead. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/4)*
- The render module must iterate over CATEGORY_TITLES dict keys (not the Category enum) to ensure correct section ordering and prevent unpopulated categories from appearing. *(source: 05_structured_memory/5)*
- Pre-existing mypy errors in extraction.py (union-attr on response.content[0].text) do not propagate to or affect compaction or render modules. *(source: 05_structured_memory/5)*
- Test helpers in test_hot_load.py use a prd.md dependency table format (`| Spec | Dependency |`) that differs from the standard parser's expected format (`| This Spec | Depends On |`), requiring the hot_load module to implement broader regex patterns to handle both formats. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/4)*
- `discover_specs()` raises `PlanError` when no specs are found, so callers like `discover_new_specs()` must catch this exception to gracefully handle empty or missing specs directories. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/4)*
- SessionRecord dataclass in `agent_fox/engine/state.py` does not have a `model` field despite design.md mentioning model info for cost breakdown. Model info must be derived from config or session outcome metadata. *(source: 07_operational_commands/1)*
- `ExecutionState.node_states` may not contain entries for all nodes in the plan (e.g., when state was written before new tasks were added). The `generate_status()` function fills missing entries with 'pending' status. *(source: 07_operational_commands/2)*
- Pytest fixture names starting with `pytest_` collide with pytest's internal plugin hook system and raise `PluginValidationError: unknown hook`. Use alternative naming conventions like `check_descriptor_pytest` instead. *(source: 08_error_autofix/1)*

## Patterns

- A _clamp() helper function centralizes range enforcement and warning logging for all numeric config fields, allowing individual @field_validator methods to remain terse. *(source: 01_core_foundation/3)*
- Playful/neutral messages are stored in module-level dicts keyed by event name, allowing easy extension without modifying the AppTheme class. *(source: 01_core_foundation/4)*
- Property tests should use tmp_path_factory.mktemp() instead of tmp_path when combined with Hypothesis, since each example needs a fresh directory. *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- Graph test fixtures use a make_graph() helper in conftest.py that wraps Node/Edge lists into a TaskGraph with default metadata. *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- Planning engine modules are organized into agent_fox/spec/ (discovery, parser) for spec-level logic and agent_fox/graph/ (types, builder, resolver, fast_mode, persistence) for graph-level operations. *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- The `discover_specs()` function returns all matching specs including those without `tasks.md` files (with `has_tasks=False`), allowing callers to handle missing task files rather than filtering them out automatically. *(source: 02_planning_engine/2)*
- The task parser uses two regex patterns: `_GROUP_PATTERN` matches top-level groups with `^- \[([ x\-])\] (\* )?(\d+)\. (.+)$` and `_SUBTASK_PATTERN` matches nested subtasks with `^\s+- \[([ x\-])\] (\d+\.\d+) (.+)$`, covering all checkbox states (unchecked, completed, in-progress). *(source: 02_planning_engine/3)*
- The graph builder sorts task groups by number within each spec before creating intra-spec edges, ensuring correct sequential ordering even when groups appear out of order in the input. *(source: 02_planning_engine/3)*
- The resolver uses heapq with (sort_key, node_id) tuples for deterministic tie-breaking in Kahn's algorithm, where sort_key is (spec_name, group_number). *(source: 02_planning_engine/4)*
- The load_plan() function returns None for both missing and corrupted files using a two-stage try/except: first for JSON parsing, then for structure validation. *(source: 02_planning_engine/4)*
- The plan CLI command uses Path.cwd() to locate .specs/ and .agent-fox/plan.json directories, making it sensitive to the current working directory. *(source: 02_planning_engine/5)*
- When patching module-level imports (e.g., `query` from claude-code-sdk), the stub module must import the name with `# noqa: F401` comment so that `patch("module.name")` can locate and patch it. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- Runner tests mock `agent_fox.session.runner.query` by patching the imported name in the runner module and providing async generator mock functions that yield mock message objects. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- Git operations in the workspace module use `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec('git', *args)` with PIPE for stdout/stderr, matching the async architecture required by the session runner. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/2)*
- Worktree cleanup uses a two-step approach: first attempt `git worktree remove --force`, then fall back to `shutil.rmtree` if the directory still exists. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/2)*
- The session runner uses a two-level async structure: run_session() catches TimeoutError and generic Exception, while _execute_query() handles actual SDK iteration. This separation allows with_timeout() to wrap only the query execution. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/3)*
- Tests mock agent_fox.session.runner.query via side_effect with async generator functions for success cases, and side_effect=Exception(...) for error cases. The timeout test patches both query and with_timeout. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/3)*
- The harvester executes rebase and abort_rebase operations from `workspace.path` (the worktree directory) rather than `repo_root` to avoid worktree branch lock conflicts. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/4)*
- CircuitBreaker.check_launch() uses 1-indexed attempts where attempt 1 is the initial try and attempts 2 through max_retries+1 are retries. Allowed attempt count equals max_retries + 1. *(source: 04_orchestrator/1)*
- SerialRunner supports both callable runners (via __call__) and runners with an execute() method by checking hasattr(runner, 'execute'). This dual support accommodates mock styles used in tests: MockSerialSessionRunner (callable) and MockSessionRunner (.execute() method). *(source: 04_orchestrator/3)*
- The orchestrator dispatches one ready task per main-loop iteration in serial mode, then re-evaluates ready tasks. This ensures newly-unblocked tasks are discovered immediately after each completion. *(source: 04_orchestrator/3)*
- The orchestrator uses an attempt tracker and error tracker initialized from session history to support correct resume behavior — attempt counts and error messages persist across sessions. *(source: 04_orchestrator/3)*
- Orchestrator dispatches sessions either serially or in parallel based on `config.parallel > 1`, with both paths converging through a shared `_process_session_result()` method. *(source: 04_orchestrator/4)*
- Test mocks differ by runner type: ParallelRunner tests use MockParallelSessionRunner (callable, records timing), while orchestrator tests use MockSessionRunner (with `.execute()` method, records calls). *(source: 04_orchestrator/4)*
- CircuitBreaker.should_stop() checks only global limits (cost ceiling, session limit) at the top of the orchestrator's main loop, while check_launch() checks all three limits (cost, session, retry) per-task during dispatch. *(source: 04_orchestrator/5)*
- The orchestrator determines which RunStatus to set (COST_LIMIT vs SESSION_LIMIT) by re-checking the specific limit conditions after should_stop() returns denied, rather than relying on the reason string from LaunchDecision. *(source: 04_orchestrator/5)*
- Memory module structure organizes code into layers: types.py (data models), store.py (persistence), extraction.py (LLM integration), filter.py (selection), compaction.py (dedup), render.py (output). *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- The `make_fact()` helper in conftest.py provides sensible defaults for all Fact dataclass fields, allowing tests to override only the fields they need to customize. *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- Property test Hypothesis strategies generate ISO 8601 timestamps for `created_at` field using `from_regex()` rather than `datetimes()` to match the string-based dataclass field. *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- Hook runner tests use real temporary shell scripts (created via `tmp_hook_script`) and marker files to verify execution order and environment variable passing, rather than mocking subprocess. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- Hot-load test helpers (`_make_minimal_tasks_md`, `_make_minimal_prd_md`, `_make_graph_with_spec`) create minimal valid spec structures in temp directories for testing graph augmentation. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- The `make_pre_tool_use_hook()` function returns a callable (not a dict with callback), matching the design.md interface where the hook directly receives `tool_name` and `tool_input` keyword arguments. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- Hook runner uses `subprocess.run()` with `capture_output=True, text=True` for stdout/stderr handling, enforces timeout via `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, and handles missing scripts via `FileNotFoundError`, producing `HookResult` with exit codes: -1 for timeout, 127 for not found, 126 for OS errors. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/2)*
- The `build_hook_env()` function copies `os.environ` and adds AF_* prefixed environment variables, ensuring hook scripts inherit the full environment including PATH. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/2)*
- The store module uses manual dict serialization (_fact_to_dict/_dict_to_fact) rather than dataclasses.asdict() to maintain explicit control over field mapping, consistent with the persistence pattern used in the orchestrator module. *(source: 05_structured_memory/2)*
- The store uses append mode ('a') for append_facts and write mode ('w') for write_facts, ensuring multiple appends accumulate while compaction can fully replace file contents. *(source: 05_structured_memory/2)*
- Extraction module uses a two-layer error pattern where `_parse_extraction_response()` raises ValueError for invalid JSON and `extract_facts()` catches it to log a warning and return an empty list, keeping parsing logic testable independently. *(source: 05_structured_memory/3)*
- Extraction tests mock `agent_fox.memory.extraction.anthropic.AsyncAnthropic` with response structured as `response.content[0].text` containing the raw JSON string for test assertions. *(source: 05_structured_memory/3)*
- The filter module matches facts on spec_name OR keyword overlap (union), not both (intersection). A fact with only a matching spec_name is relevant even with zero keyword matches. *(source: 05_structured_memory/4)*
- Recency bonus computation uses `datetime.fromisoformat()` to parse ISO 8601 timestamps from the Fact `created_at` field, with fallback to `now` for unparseable values. *(source: 05_structured_memory/4)*
- Compaction deduplication uses a two-pass approach: first pass identifies the earliest fact per content hash, second pass preserves original ordering among deduplicated survivors. *(source: 05_structured_memory/5)*
- Supersession resolution collects all superseded IDs (targets of `supersedes` fields) into a set and filters them in a single pass; transitive chains are handled implicitly because intermediate facts are also targets. *(source: 05_structured_memory/5)*
- The security module uses `PurePosixPath.name` to strip path prefixes from command strings, which works correctly for both absolute paths and plain command names. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/3)*
- Hot-load dependency validation checks against all known specs (existing dependency graph plus newly discovered specs) to properly handle cross-references between new specs and existing ones. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/4)*
- Property test TS-07-P1 validates count consistency invariant end-to-end by calling `generate_status()` with file-based state and plan files, rather than testing only the data model invariant on constructed reports. *(source: 07_operational_commands/1)*
- The `generate_status()` function loads plan.json via `load_plan()` from `agent_fox.graph.persistence` (returns `TaskGraph | None`) and state.jsonl via `StateManager.load()` (returns `ExecutionState | None`). Missing plan raises `AgentFoxError`; missing state is handled gracefully with all-pending defaults. *(source: 07_operational_commands/2)*
- Per-spec breakdown uses `Node.spec_name` from the graph to group tasks, falling back to parsing the node_id prefix (before ':') when the node isn't in the graph. *(source: 07_operational_commands/2)*
- The fix module uses `StrEnum` (not plain `str, Enum`) for enum definitions like `CheckCategory` and `TerminationReason`, consistent with existing enums such as `NodeStatus` in `graph/types.py`. *(source: 08_error_autofix/1)*
- Collector tests mock external dependencies at their import site (e.g., `agent_fox.fix.collector.subprocess.run` rather than `subprocess.run`) to match the project's mocking convention. *(source: 08_error_autofix/1)*

## Decisions

- Use `StrEnum` (not `str, Enum`) for `ModelTier` because ruff UP042 requires it for Python 3.12+. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- Specify `claude-code-sdk>=0.0.1` (not `>=0.1`) because PyPI only has versions up to 0.0.25. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- resolve_model() uses deferred import of ConfigError to avoid circular imports between models.py and errors.py. *(source: 01_core_foundation/2)*
- Cost calculation uses simple arithmetic (tokens / 1_000_000) * price_per_m without rounding, returning raw float for maximum precision in downstream calculations. *(source: 01_core_foundation/2)*
- Numeric clamping uses pydantic @field_validator with mode='after' instead of Field(ge=, le=) constraints because the requirement specifies clamping behavior (silently adjust out-of-range values) rather than rejection via ValidationError. *(source: 01_core_foundation/3)*
- Config loading uses tomllib (stdlib in Python 3.11+) for TOML parsing, with tomllib.TOMLDecodeError caught and converted to ConfigError, and pydantic ValidationError also caught and converted with field location details. *(source: 01_core_foundation/3)*
- Logging configures the `agent_fox` namespace logger (not root) to avoid polluting output from third-party libraries; handler deduplication prevents repeated `setup_logging()` calls from stacking handlers. *(source: 01_core_foundation/4)*
- Persistence functions (save_plan, load_plan) live in a separate agent_fox/graph/persistence.py module rather than in types.py, to keep data models separate from I/O. *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- NodeStatus is defined in agent_fox/graph/types.py using StrEnum; core/types.py is a placeholder that may re-export it later. *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- The `discover_specs()` function imports `PlanError` from `agent_fox.core.errors` for error handling, establishing a dependency on core errors but intentionally avoiding dependencies on graph types. *(source: 02_planning_engine/2)*
- The `parse_cross_deps()` function uses sentinel group numbers (from_group=0, to_group=0) for spec-level dependencies because the prd.md table only contains spec names, not group numbers. The graph builder later resolves 0 to the first or last group number as appropriate. *(source: 02_planning_engine/3)*
- Persistence uses manual dict-based serialization instead of dataclasses.asdict() because NodeStatus (StrEnum) and frozen dataclasses require controlled conversion. *(source: 02_planning_engine/4)*
- Plan persistence reuse (02-REQ-6.3) checks for existing plan.json before rebuilding; the --reanalyze flag explicitly skips this cache check to force recomputation. *(source: 02_planning_engine/5)*
- Allowlist hook tests are separated into a dedicated `test_security.py` file rather than placed in `test_runner.py` to improve clarity and organization. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- The `with_timeout` function uses PEP 695 type parameters (`async def with_timeout[T](...)`) instead of `TypeVar` to satisfy the ruff UP047 rule. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- `delete_branch()` detects 'not found' in stderr to distinguish missing-branch errors (handled as no-op with warning) from other failures (which raise WorkspaceError). *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/2)*
- Data models (SessionRecord, ExecutionState, RunStatus, LaunchDecision) are defined in their respective stub modules rather than shared locations to support proper test imports. *(source: 04_orchestrator/1)*
- StateManager persists ExecutionState using JSON Lines format where each line is a complete snapshot; load() reads the last line, save() appends new lines. *(source: 04_orchestrator/2)*
- In-progress tasks from prior interrupted runs are reset to pending status during state loading, with attempt tracking preserved from session history. This implements exactly-once semantics per requirement 04-REQ-7.E1. *(source: 04_orchestrator/3)*
- ParallelRunner uses asyncio.Semaphore to bound concurrency instead of ThreadPoolExecutor, maintaining consistency with the project's async-first design philosophy. *(source: 04_orchestrator/4)*
- In ParallelRunner, the on_complete callback executes outside the semaphore but under the state lock. This design allows new sessions to start while state writes occur, maximizing throughput. *(source: 04_orchestrator/4)*
- Exactly-once semantics in parallel mode is enforced by marking tasks `in_progress` in the orchestrator before building the batch, not in the runner. This prevents the same task from being included in multiple batches. *(source: 04_orchestrator/4)*
- When circuit breaker denies a task launch due to retry limit, the task is blocked with cascade. For cost or session limit denials, the main loop re-checks via should_stop() and sets the appropriate RunStatus (COST_LIMIT or SESSION_LIMIT). *(source: 04_orchestrator/5)*
- Category and ConfidenceLevel use StrEnum instead of plain str Enum for consistency with NodeStatus in graph/types.py. *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- Pure data type tests (enums, dataclasses) pass immediately against stubs because the types themselves are complete implementations, following the same pattern as error hierarchy stubs. *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- The `DEFAULT_ALLOWLIST` constant is defined directly in the stub module (not as a NotImplementedError stub) because it is a pure data constant. This means tests that only inspect the constant pass immediately, consistent with the project convention for pure data types. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- Sync interval barrier trigger tests (TS-06-E7) test pure arithmetic logic without any module dependency, so they pass immediately against stubs. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- `check_command_allowed()` delegates to `extract_command_name()` for command parsing, so empty/whitespace commands raise `SecurityError` from `extract_command_name` rather than returning `(False, msg)` from `check_command_allowed`. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/3)*
- `should_trigger_barrier()` is implemented as a pure boolean check using the formula `sync_interval > 0 and completed_count > 0 and completed_count % sync_interval == 0`, directly matching the specification in design.md. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/4)*
- PyYAML (`pyyaml>=6.0`) was added as a runtime dependency in `pyproject.toml` to enable YAML output formatting. *(source: 07_operational_commands/1)*

## Conventions

- All Python files use `from __future__ import annotations` for modern type hint syntax. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- Error hierarchy uses simple class inheritance with `**context` kwargs pattern for passing contextual data to exceptions (e.g., `AgentFoxError("msg", field="x")`). *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- Package structure follows: `agent_fox/cli/`, `agent_fox/core/`, `agent_fox/infra/`, `agent_fox/ui/` with matching test structure in `tests/unit/`, `tests/property/`, `tests/integration/`. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- MODEL_REGISTRY keys are full model ID strings (e.g. 'claude-sonnet-4-6'), and TIER_DEFAULTS maps ModelTier enum values to those keys. *(source: 01_core_foundation/2)*
- All pydantic ConfigDict models must set extra='ignore' to handle unknown keys, and this must be applied to every sub-model (not just top-level AgentFoxConfig) to properly ignore unknown fields within known configuration sections. *(source: 01_core_foundation/3)*
- `invoke_without_command=True` is used instead of custom `BannerGroup.invoke()` override to handle no-subcommand banner display while avoiding interference with Click's built-in unknown-subcommand error handling (exit code 2). *(source: 01_core_foundation/4)*
- Git operations in the init command use `subprocess.run()` rather than a git library, keeping dependencies minimal. *(source: 01_core_foundation/4)*
- Theme system validates Rich style strings at theme creation time using `Style.parse()`, falling back to defaults from `_DEFAULT_STYLES` dict on invalid values. *(source: 01_core_foundation/4)*
- Test files follow a naming convention where class names map to test spec IDs (e.g., TestDiscoverSpecsSorted maps to TS-02-1). *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- CrossSpecDep fields use from_spec/from_group (the spec declaring the dependency) and to_spec/to_group (the spec being depended on), matching the prd.md table direction. *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- Spec folder discovery uses a regex pattern `^(\d{2})_(.+)$` that requires exactly two-digit prefixes. Only directories matching this pattern are recognized as valid specs. *(source: 02_planning_engine/2)*
- Edge direction in the dependency graph is opposite to CrossSpecDep field naming: CrossSpecDep(from_spec=declaring, to_spec=depended-on) becomes Edge(source=to_spec:to_group, target=from_spec:from_group). The builder handles this translation. *(source: 02_planning_engine/3)*
- CLI end-to-end tests (TestPlanCLIEndToEnd / TS-02-11) belong to task group 5 and are expected to fail until the plan CLI command is implemented. *(source: 02_planning_engine/4)*
- Integration tests use tmp_git_repo fixture which os.chdir's into the temp repo to test plan command behavior with correct working directory context. *(source: 02_planning_engine/5)*
- Async tests use pytest-asyncio with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` in pyproject.toml, so `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator is not required (though included for explicitness in existing tests). *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- Workspace test fixtures are located in `tests/unit/workspace/conftest.py`. The `tmp_worktree_repo` fixture provides a temporary git repository with a develop branch, and helper functions (`add_commit_to_branch`, `get_branch_tip`, `list_branches`) are defined as plain functions rather than fixtures. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- Session test fixtures live in `tests/unit/session/conftest.py` and include: `tmp_spec_dir`, `default_config`, `short_timeout_config`, `small_allowlist_config`, and `workspace_info`. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/1)*
- `run_git()` is the single low-level function that all other git operations delegate to; it centralizes check/raise semantics so callers don't need to. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/2)*
- `merge_fast_forward()` and `rebase_onto()` raise `IntegrationError` (not `WorkspaceError`) since they belong to the harvesting/integration domain rather than workspace management. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/2)*
- The effective allowlist is computed as: if config.security.bash_allowlist is set (not None), use it as replacement; otherwise use DEFAULT_BASH_ALLOWLIST + config.security.bash_allowlist_extend. *(source: 03_session_and_workspace/3)*
- Engine modules are located under agent_fox/engine/ consisting of six files: orchestrator.py, serial.py, parallel.py, circuit.py, state.py, and sync.py. Corresponding unit and property tests mirror this structure in tests/unit/engine/ and tests/property/engine/. *(source: 04_orchestrator/1)*
- Orchestrator tests use class-based grouping where test class names map to test spec IDs (e.g., TestReadyTasksIdentified → TS-04-2, TestCascadeBlockingLinear → TS-04-6). *(source: 04_orchestrator/1)*
- Stub modules use raise NotImplementedError in all methods to ensure test failures occur at assertion level rather than import level, enabling proper test collection. *(source: 04_orchestrator/1)*
- RunStatus uses StrEnum instead of str, Enum per ruff rule UP042. *(source: 04_orchestrator/1)*
- ruff requires imports sorted in order: stdlib → third-party → first-party → local. Use 'ruff check --fix' to auto-sort. Property test files import hypothesis before agent_fox modules. *(source: 04_orchestrator/1)*
- Plan edges use source → target notation where source must complete before target. The Orchestrator converts these to GraphSync edges dict format: {target: [source, ...]} mapping each node to its dependency predecessors. *(source: 04_orchestrator/3)*
- Session runner factories must return either a callable with signature `(node_id, attempt, previous_error) -> SessionRecord` or an object with an `execute()` method. Runner code checks `hasattr(runner, 'execute')` to support both patterns. *(source: 04_orchestrator/4)*
- Stub modules import external dependencies with `# noqa: F401` to enable mocking via `unittest.mock.patch()` to find the attribute on the module. *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- Test file structure mirrors module organization with tests/unit/memory/test_{module}.py for unit tests and tests/property/memory/test_{module}_props.py for property tests. *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- Hook test fixtures live in `tests/unit/hooks/conftest.py`. The `tmp_hook_script` fixture is a factory function that creates executable shell scripts with controlled content and exit codes. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- Test file structure mirrors module organization: `tests/unit/hooks/test_runner.py` for `agent_fox/hooks/runner.py`, `tests/unit/hooks/test_security.py` for `agent_fox/hooks/security.py`, `tests/unit/hooks/test_hot_load.py` for `agent_fox/engine/hot_load.py`. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- Security property tests use Hypothesis strategies for command-like strings with alphabet restricted to letters, numbers, and common path characters (`_-./`). *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/1)*
- Per-hook failure mode is looked up from `config.modes` dict using the script path as key, defaulting to `"abort"` when not found, per requirement 06-REQ-2.3. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/2)*
- Write operations (append_facts, write_facts) catch OSError and log errors without raising, per requirement 05-REQ-3.E2. Read operations (load_all_facts) return empty lists for missing files without logging errors. *(source: 05_structured_memory/2)*
- The ruff linter enforces UP017: use `datetime.UTC` instead of `datetime.timezone.utc` for Python 3.12+. *(source: 05_structured_memory/4)*
- The `make_pre_tool_use_hook()` function returns a plain callable (closure) that accepts `tool_name` and `tool_input` as keyword arguments and returns a dict with `{"decision": "allow"}` or `{"decision": "block", "message": "..."}` keys. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/3)*
- Import `Callable` from `collections.abc` (not `typing`) to satisfy ruff UP035 rule in this project. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/3)*
- Reporting test fixtures are centralized in `tests/unit/reporting/conftest.py` with helper functions: `make_session_record()`, `make_execution_state()`, `write_state_file()`, `write_plan_file()`, and `hours_ago()`. *(source: 07_operational_commands/1)*
- Reset property tests use `TaskGraph` objects directly (via `agent_fox.graph.types`) and call `save_plan`/`load_plan` from `agent_fox.graph.persistence` rather than writing raw JSON to maintain consistency with the persistence layer. *(source: 07_operational_commands/1)*
- Problem tasks (failed/blocked) derive their reasons from different sources: failed tasks use the last `error_message` from `SessionRecord` in session_history, while blocked tasks derive their reason from predecessor analysis using `TaskGraph.predecessors()`. *(source: 07_operational_commands/2)*
- Stub modules in `agent_fox/fix/` import external dependencies with `# noqa: F401` comments (e.g., `subprocess`, `anthropic`) to enable mocking via `unittest.mock.patch()` in tests. *(source: 08_error_autofix/1)*
- Property tests for the fix module are located in `tests/unit/fix/test_*_props.py` alongside unit tests, following the task specification. Earlier project specs have tests in `tests/property/`. *(source: 08_error_autofix/1)*

## Anti-Patterns

*(No facts in this category.)*

## Fragile Areas

- Property tests using `tmp_path_factory` with Hypothesis: each Hypothesis example creates a new temp directory, so use `tmp_path_factory.mktemp()` instead of the `tmp_path` fixture. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- Integration tests change working directory via `os.chdir()` — must restore in fixture teardown to avoid side effects on subsequent tests. *(source: 01_core_foundation/1)*
- CrossSpecDep field naming (from_spec = declaring spec, to_spec = depended-on spec) is opposite to edge direction in the graph; the builder must translate so edges go from to_spec:to_group -> from_spec:from_group. *(source: 02_planning_engine/1)*
- Cross-spec dependency resolution between prd.md and discovered specs is fragile; incomplete filtering can cause dangling references that break graph building. *(source: 02_planning_engine/5)*
- The `_dispatch_parallel` on_complete closure captures `attempt_tracker` and `error_tracker` dicts by reference. Changes to these dicts during callback execution affect subsequent callbacks in the same batch, but this is safe because callbacks are serialized under the lock. *(source: 04_orchestrator/4)*
- Extraction test mocking depends on the exact import path `agent_fox.memory.extraction.anthropic.AsyncAnthropic` — if the extraction module changes how it imports anthropic, all extraction tests require updating. *(source: 05_structured_memory/1)*
- Hypothesis property tests spawning subprocesses are sensitive to the default 200ms deadline because OS process creation overhead can cause first subprocess invocations to exceed the timeout. Use `deadline=None` in `@settings()` for subprocess-based property tests. *(source: 06_hooks_sync_security/2)*

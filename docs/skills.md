# Skills

agent-fox ships with a set of Claude Code skills -- slash commands that guide
you through common workflows like writing specs, documenting decisions, and
simplifying code. Skills are interactive: you invoke them in Claude Code and
work through the steps together with the agent.

## Installation

Install all bundled skills into your project with:

```bash
agent-fox init --skills
```

This copies each skill template to `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`, making
them available as slash commands in Claude Code. Re-running the command updates
skills to the latest bundled versions.

## af-spec

**Spec-driven development: from idea to implementation-ready spec package.**

Transforms a PRD, product idea, or GitHub issue into four specification
artifacts with full traceability from requirements through design, tests, and
tasks.

### What it produces

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `prd.md` | Finalized product requirements document |
| `requirements.md` | EARS-patterned acceptance criteria and edge cases |
| `design.md` | Interfaces, data models, correctness properties, error handling |
| `test_spec.md` | Language-agnostic test contracts with full requirement coverage |
| `tasks.md` | Implementation checklist (test-first: group 1 is always "write failing tests") |

All files are saved to `.specs/NN_specification_name/`.

### Workflow

1. **Understand the PRD** -- accepts a file path, GitHub issue URL, or inline
   description. Identifies ambiguities and asks for clarification.
2. **Learn the context** -- analyzes the existing codebase, finds the next spec
   number, identifies cross-spec dependencies.
3. **Write requirements** -- EARS syntax (WHEN/SHALL/IF/THEN), max 10
   requirements per spec, automated verification only.
4. **Write design** -- architecture overview with Mermaid diagrams, typed
   interfaces, correctness properties (formal invariants testable via
   property-based tests), error handling table.
5. **Write test spec** -- translates every acceptance criterion and correctness
   property into test contracts with preconditions, inputs, expected outputs,
   and assertion pseudocode. 100% coverage matrix.
6. **Write tasks** -- group 1 is always "write failing spec tests." Subsequent
   groups implement code. Each group has a verification subtask with specific
   test commands.

### When to use

Starting a new feature from a PRD, idea, or GitHub issue. When you want
test-first, spec-driven development with full traceability.

---

## af-fix

**Autonomous code fixer: from GitHub issue to landed fix.**

Takes a GitHub issue URL, deeply analyzes the problem, implements the fix, and
lands it on `develop` -- all in a single pass with minimal user interaction.

### Workflow

1. **Parse and fetch** -- validates the issue URL, fetches issue context
   (title, body, comments, linked PRs) via `gh`.
2. **Understand the codebase** -- reads docs, explores structure, runs existing
   tests to establish a baseline.
3. **Deep analysis** -- classifies the issue (bug, feature, refactor),
   performs root cause analysis for bugs, designs minimal solution for
   features. Posts an analysis comment to the issue.
4. **Implement** -- test-first: writes a regression test that fails, then the
   minimal fix. Runs all quality checks.
5. **Land** -- commits with conventional message (`fixes #N`), pushes feature
   branch, creates PR via `gh pr create`, merges into `develop`.

### When to use

When you have a GitHub issue and want it analyzed, fixed, tested, and landed
autonomously.

## af-spec-audit

**Spec compliance audit and drift detection.**

Compares what the specifications say should be built against what was actually
built. Produces a structured compliance report with actionable mitigations.

### What it produces

A report at `docs/audits/audit-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md` with:
- Summary table (compliant, drifted, unimplemented, superseded counts)
- Per-requirement classification with drift details
- Mitigation suggestions (change spec / get well spec / needs manual review)
- Priority assignments (high / medium / low)
- In-progress caveats (distinguishes expected gaps from real drift)
- Extra behavior detection (code not covered by any spec)

### Workflow

1. **Discover specs** -- scans `.specs/` for `NN_name` folders, reads all spec
   files in order.
2. **Build supersession chain** -- checks for explicit (`## Supersedes`) and
   implicit supersession between specs.
3. **Analyze the codebase** -- reads source code in depth, compares function
   signatures, data models, and error handling against design docs.
4. **Classify requirements** -- compliant, drifted (behavioral / structural /
   missing-edge-case), unimplemented, or superseded.
5. **Handle in-progress specs** -- uses `tasks.md` checkbox state to
   distinguish expected gaps from drift.
6. **Suggest mitigations** -- one per drift item, with priority.
7. **Generate report** -- saves to `docs/audits/audit-report-{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`.

### When to use

Verifying spec compliance after implementation sessions. Auditing completeness
before a review milestone or release. Detecting spec drift over time.

## af-code-simplifier

**Architecture and code-level simplification.**

Acts as a senior architect focused on making codebases smaller, clearer, and
easier to maintain. Analyzes at both architecture and code level, with a bias
toward removing code and collapsing unnecessary abstractions.

### Workflow

1. **Identify target** -- accepts a file, directory, or entire codebase.
2. **Structural analysis** -- maps dependency graph, detects over-engineering
   (single-implementation interfaces, pass-through wrappers, YAGNI
   abstractions), identifies consolidation candidates and dead weight.
3. **Code-level analysis** -- finds redundancy (DRY violations), readability
   issues (complex conditionals, deep nesting), outdated patterns, and
   structural smells (god classes, feature envy).
4. **Propose plan** -- three tiers: quick wins (dead code, naming), structural
   (file consolidation, inlining), design-level (pattern application, module
   reorganization). Waits for approval on tiers 2-3.
5. **Refactor** -- applies agreed changes with guard clauses, lookup tables,
   composition, modern idioms.
6. **Present changes** -- before/after comparison, LOC delta, file count delta.

### Priority hierarchy

1. Maintainability (always wins)
2. Readability
3. Reduced complexity
4. Fewer files/lines (signal, not goal)

### When to use

When code needs simplification, deduplication, structural improvement, or
complexity reduction. When you say "clean up", "simplify", or "refactor."

---

## af-security-audit

**Application security review and vulnerability analysis.**

Acts as a senior appsec reviewer: maps trust boundaries and attack surface,
finds unsafe patterns and missing controls, explains exploit potential in
defensive terms, and recommends mitigations. Complements (does not replace)
automated scanners and dedicated penetration tests.

### Workflow

1. **Identify target** -- accepts a file, directory, or security-relevant slice
   of the codebase.
2. **Map attack surface** -- entry points, trust boundaries, data flows, and
   high-risk components (auth, parsing, crypto, subprocess, filesystem).
3. **Code-level analysis** -- injection, authn/z, crypto and secrets, disclosure,
   XSS/CSRF/SSRF where applicable, deserialization, path issues, concurrency,
   business-logic abuse, and dependency risk flags.
4. **Mitigation plan** -- tiers: immediate fixes, short-term hardening, structural
   improvements. Each finding includes severity, impact, and verification ideas.
5. **Optional remediation** -- minimal targeted code changes if the user opts in.
6. **Report** -- executive summary, findings list, positive observations, residual
   risks.

### Priority hierarchy

1. Direct compromise (RCE, auth bypass, bulk data exposure)
2. Integrity and authorization
3. Confidentiality leaks
4. Availability and abuse

### When to use

When you need a structured security review, threat-oriented code analysis,
hardening guidance, or answers to "what could go wrong here?" and "how do we
mitigate it?"

## af-adr

**Architecture Decision Records.**

Guides creation of ADRs that capture the context, alternatives, rationale, and
consequences of architectural decisions.

### What it produces

A markdown file at `docs/adr/NN-imperative-verb-phrase.md` with sections:

- **Context** -- the situation and forces (not the decision itself)
- **Decision Drivers** -- key requirements and constraints
- **Options Considered** -- at least two, each with honest pros and cons
- **Decision** -- chosen option with rationale tied to drivers
- **Consequences** -- positive, negative/trade-offs, and follow-up actions
- **References** -- RFCs, spikes, external docs

### Workflow

1. **Gather context** -- collects the decision, problem, alternatives, reasons,
   trade-offs, stakeholders, and status. Explores the codebase to verify
   claims.
2. **Determine location** -- finds existing ADR directory or creates
   `docs/adr/`. Determines next sequential number.
3. **Write the ADR** -- structured template with all sections.
4. **Quality check** -- validates: context explains WHY, at least two
   alternatives, rationale connects to drivers, consequences include negatives,
   no vague language.

### When to use

Making or documenting an architectural decision (technology choice, design
pattern, infrastructure change, build vs. buy).

## af-reverse-engineer

**Reverse-engineer a PRD from an existing codebase.**

Reads the codebase and produces a user-facing Product Requirements Document
describing what the product does -- never how it is implemented. The prime
directive is "WHAT, never HOW."

### What it produces

A `prd.md` with sections:

- Product Overview, Goals & Non-Goals
- User Personas (2-4 max)
- User Workflows (end-to-end journeys)
- Functional Requirements (EARS syntax)
- Configuration & Input Specification
- Output Specification
- Error Handling & User Feedback
- Constraints & Assumptions
- Open Questions

### Workflow

1. **Orient** -- reads entry points, public interfaces, configuration surface,
   and tests (for intent, not mechanics). Treats code as the source of truth.
2. **Translate** -- converts every code observation into a user-facing
   statement. No class names, function names, or implementation details.
3. **Write the PRD** -- 11 sections, all in user/product language.
4. **Quality checks** -- stakeholder test (could you present this to a VP?),
   implementation leak test (no code terms), testability test (can QA write
   tests from this?).

### When to use

When you have an existing codebase with no (or outdated) product documentation
and need a user-facing PRD. When onboarding new stakeholders.

# Spec Audit & Drift Detection

You are a senior quality engineer performing a spec compliance audit. Your job
is to compare what the specifications in `.specs/` say should be built against
what was actually built in the codebase. You produce a structured compliance
report listing covered requirements, drifted requirements, unimplemented
requirements, and superseded requirements — with actionable mitigation
suggestions for each drift item.

Follow the steps below **in order**. Do not skip steps.

---

## Step 1: Discover and Read Specs

Scan the `.specs/` directory for specification folders.

### Discovery Rules

1. List all directories in `.specs/` whose names match the pattern
   `NN_snake_case_name` (where NN is a two-digit number, e.g. `01_fast_planning`).
2. Process specs in **ascending numeric order** (01 before 02 before 03, etc.).
3. For each valid spec folder, read these files:
   - `requirements.md` — EARS-patterned acceptance criteria and edge cases.
   - `design.md` — interfaces, data models, correctness properties, error
     handling table.
   - `tasks.md` — task groups with checkbox state (for completion tracking).
   - `prd.md` — for supersession declarations (`## Supersedes` section).
4. Only read files tracked by git. Skip anything matched by `.gitignore`.
   When in doubt, run `git ls-files` to see what's tracked.

### Error Handling

- IF a spec folder is missing `requirements.md` or `design.md`, THEN **skip**
  that spec and log a warning in the report: "Spec NN_name: skipped — missing
  requirements.md/design.md."
- IF a spec folder name does not match the expected pattern (e.g. missing
  numeric prefix, non-standard naming), THEN **skip** it and log a warning.
- IF `.specs/` contains **no valid spec folders**, THEN report
  "No specs found in .specs/ — nothing to audit." and stop.

### Output of This Step

A list of spec entries, each containing:
- Spec number and name
- Parsed requirements (IDs and text)
- Design interfaces and data models
- Task completion state (checked vs. unchecked checkboxes)

---

## Step 2: Build Supersession Chain

Determine which specs (or individual requirements) have been superseded by
later specs. Later specs — those with a higher numeric prefix — can
legitimately change or override requirements from earlier specs.

### Explicit Supersession

Check each spec's `prd.md` for a `## Supersedes` section. If found, mark all
requirements from the superseded spec as "superseded" and exclude them from
drift analysis.

Example:
```markdown
## Supersedes
- `09_bundled_templates` — fully replaced by this spec.
```

### Implicit Supersession (Superseded by Implication)

Even without an explicit `## Supersedes` section, a later spec may redefine
behavior originally specified in an earlier spec. Detect this by:

1. Comparing the module references in each spec's `design.md`.
2. If spec N (higher number) defines requirements covering the **same
   module, function, or behavior** as spec M (lower number), flag spec M's
   overlapping requirements as "superseded by implication" and note which
   later spec supersedes them.
3. Use the requirement text and EARS patterns to confirm behavioral overlap —
   don't flag unrelated requirements that happen to reference the same module.

### Compute Effective Requirements

The **effective requirements** are the union of all non-superseded requirements
across all specs, with later specs taking precedence for overlapping behavior.

### Edge Cases

- IF two specs of different numbers both claim to supersede the same earlier
  spec, THEN use the higher-numbered spec as the effective superseder and log
  a warning.
- IF a supersession reference points to a spec that does not exist, THEN log
  a warning and ignore the supersession declaration.

---

## Step 3: Analyze the Codebase

Read the source code to understand what was actually built.

### Reading Strategy

1. Read source files in the project, respecting `.gitignore` exclusions.
   Focus on the main source directory (e.g. `agent_fox/`, `src/`, or
   whatever the project uses).
2. Use the module references in `design.md` to map spec requirements to
   actual source files. For each module referenced in a spec's design doc,
   locate the corresponding file in the codebase.
3. Read the code in depth — don't skim. Understand function signatures,
   class definitions, data models (dataclasses, enums, protocols), and
   control flow.

### Design Document Comparison

For each spec's `design.md`:
- Compare **function signatures** defined in the design doc against actual
  function signatures in the codebase. Note differences in parameter names,
  types, return types, or missing/extra parameters.
- Compare **data model definitions** (dataclasses, enums, protocols) in the
  design doc against actual definitions in the code. Note missing fields,
  extra fields, type mismatches, or renamed classes.
- Compare the **error handling table** in the design doc against actual error
  handling behavior in the code. Check that each documented error condition
  produces the specified behavior.

### Edge Cases

- IF a module referenced in `design.md` does not exist in the codebase, THEN
  report it as an unimplemented component.
- IF a source file exists but is empty, THEN treat it as unimplemented.
- IF `design.md` does not contain typed interfaces (e.g. early or informal
  specs), THEN skip interface comparison for that spec and note it in the
  report.

## Step 4: Classify Each Requirement

For each effective requirement (from Step 2), compare it against the code
analysis (from Step 3) and classify it into exactly one category:

### Classification Categories

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Compliant** | The code behavior matches the spec's acceptance criteria. |
| **Drifted** | The code behavior diverges from the spec. |
| **Unimplemented** | No corresponding code exists for this requirement. |
| **Superseded** | This requirement was overridden by a later spec. |

### Drift Types

When a requirement is classified as "Drifted", assign a drift type:

| Drift Type | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `behavioral` | The code does something different from what the spec says. |
| `structural` | The architecture, interfaces, or data models differ from the design doc. |
| `missing-edge-case` | The happy path works, but edge case handling differs from the spec. |

### Drift Details

For each drifted requirement, describe:
1. **Spec says** — what the requirement specifies (quote the EARS text).
2. **Code does** — what the code actually does (describe the observed behavior).

### Partial Implementation

IF a requirement is partially implemented (some acceptance criteria met, others
not), THEN classify it as "Drifted" and list which criteria are met vs. not met.

---

## Step 5: Handle In-Progress Specs

Not all specs may be fully implemented. Distinguish between genuine drift and
expected gaps from work still in progress.

### Completion State Check

1. For each spec, read `tasks.md` and count checked (`- [x]`) vs. unchecked
   (`- [ ]`) items. Calculate the **completion percentage**.
2. A spec is "in-progress" if it has any unchecked items in `tasks.md`.

### Classification Rules

- WHEN a spec's `tasks.md` contains unchecked items, classify unimplemented
  requirements from that spec as **expected gaps** rather than drift. Report
  them in a dedicated "In-Progress Caveats" section, separate from drift.
- **Important exception:** IF a spec has **all tasks.md items checked** but
  requirements are still unimplemented, THEN classify those as "Drifted" (not
  "in progress"), since the work was marked as complete.

---

## Step 6: Suggest Mitigations

For each drifted requirement, suggest exactly one mitigation:

### Mitigation Types

| Mitigation | When to Use | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Change spec** | The code behavior appears to be an intentional improvement or evolution beyond what the spec describes. | Update the spec to match the code — the spec is stale, the code is correct. |
| **Get well spec** | The code behavior appears to be a regression, omission, or unintentional deviation. | Create a corrective spec to bring the code back in line with the original intent. |
| **Needs manual review** | You cannot determine whether drift is intentional or unintentional. | Flag for human decision — explain the ambiguity. |

### Decision Heuristics

Use these heuristics to choose between "Change spec" and "Get well spec":

- **Change spec** signals:
  - The code adds functionality beyond the spec (enhancement, not omission).
  - The code uses a different but reasonable approach to achieve the same goal.
  - A later spec's implementation naturally altered this behavior as a side effect.
  - The code reflects common patterns or best practices that the spec didn't anticipate.

- **Get well spec** signals:
  - The code is missing a required behavior that the spec explicitly calls out.
  - An edge case specified in the requirements is not handled.
  - The code contradicts the spec's intent (does the opposite).
  - An error condition specified in the design doc is not handled.

### Priority Assignment

Assign a priority to each mitigation:

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| `high` | Functional impact — user-facing behavior is wrong or missing. |
| `medium` | Structural divergence — interfaces, data models, or architecture differ but behavior may be acceptable. |
| `low` | Minor or cosmetic differences — naming, ordering, formatting. |

---

## Step 7: Detect Extra Behavior (Best-Effort)

Perform a **best-effort scan** for notable code behavior that does not trace to
any spec requirement.

- Compare the list of modules and functions in the codebase against the modules
  referenced in any spec's `design.md`.
- If you notice significant functionality (commands, API endpoints, major
  classes) that aren't covered by any spec, mention them in a dedicated
  "Extra Behavior" section.
- This is best-effort — do not perform an exhaustive search. Note obvious
  unspecified behavior if spotted during analysis.
- IF no extra behavior is detected, omit the "Extra Behavior" section or state
  "None detected."

---

## Step 8: Generate the Audit Report

Produce the compliance report and save it.

### Report Template

Use this exact structure:

```markdown
# Spec Audit Report

**Generated:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Branch:** {current git branch}
**Specs analyzed:** {count}

## Summary

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Compliant | N |
| Drifted | N |
| Unimplemented | N |
| Superseded | N |
| In-progress (expected gaps) | N |

## Compliant Requirements

| Requirement | Spec | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | NN_spec_name | Brief description |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Drifted Requirements

### NN-REQ-X.Y: {title}

**Spec says:** {what the requirement specifies}
**Code does:** {what the code actually does}
**Drift type:** {behavioral | structural | missing-edge-case}
**Suggested mitigation:** {Change spec | Get well spec | Needs manual review}
**Priority:** {high | medium | low}
**Rationale:** {why this mitigation is suggested}

---

(Repeat for each drifted requirement)

## Unimplemented Requirements

| Requirement | Spec | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | NN_spec_name | Brief description |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Superseded Requirements

| Requirement | Original Spec | Superseded By | Type |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | NN_spec_name | MM_spec_name | explicit / implicit |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## In-Progress Caveats

### NN_spec_name (completion: XX%)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Expected gap | Task group N not yet implemented |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Extra Behavior (Best-Effort)

- {Description of notable unspecified behavior, if any}

## Mitigation Summary

| Requirement | Mitigation | Priority |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Change spec | high |
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Get well spec | medium |
| NN-REQ-X.Y | Needs manual review | low |
| ... | ... | ... |
```

### Output

1. **Save** the report as `docs/audit-report.md`. If the `docs/` directory
   does not exist, create it first. If a previous `docs/audit-report.md`
   exists, overwrite it with the new report.
2. **Display** the full report in the conversation so the user can review it
   immediately.

## Parsing Reference

These patterns appear in spec files. Use them to parse requirements and design
documents consistently.

| Pattern | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Spec folder name | `\d{2}_[a-z_]+` | `05_structured_memory` |
| Requirement ID | `NN-REQ-X.Y` | `05-REQ-3.2` |
| Edge case ID | `NN-REQ-X.EY` | `05-REQ-3.E1` |
| EARS keywords | WHEN, WHILE, WHERE, SHALL, IF, THEN | uppercase |
| Supersedes heading | `## Supersedes` | in prd.md |
| Dependencies heading | `## Dependencies` | in prd.md |
| Checkbox unchecked | `- [ ]` | tasks.md |
| Checkbox checked | `- [x]` | tasks.md |
| Checkbox in-progress | `- [-]` | tasks.md |

## Guidelines

- **The code is the source of truth for behavior.** The spec is the source of
  truth for intent. Your job is to measure the gap.
- **Read the code in depth.** Don't skim. Understand how modules interact,
  what functions actually do, and what error conditions are handled.
- **Be precise.** When reporting drift, quote the specific requirement text and
  describe the specific code behavior. Avoid vague statements like "the code
  doesn't match."
- **Be fair.** Not all divergence is bad. Code that exceeds spec requirements
  is not necessarily drifted — it may be an enhancement that the spec should
  acknowledge.
- **Account for evolution.** Always check whether a later spec explains a
  divergence before flagging it as drift.
